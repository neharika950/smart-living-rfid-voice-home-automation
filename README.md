# Smart Living: RFID and Voice-Controlled Home Automation

This project implements a secure and intelligent home automation system using ESP32 microcontrollers. It combines RFID access control, keypad authentication, voice-based commands, and IoT-based device automation for a seamless smart living experience.

## 🔍 Overview

- **RFID & Keypad-Based Entry**: Enables secure access control for rooms and garage.
- **Voice Control & IoT Integration**: Controls lights, fans, and appliances via Google Assistant and Blynk.
- **Multi-ESP32 Communication**: Uses UART between two ESP32 boards for coordinated actions.
- **Sensor Integration**: Includes PIR motion, DHT11 temperature/humidity sensors, and OLED displays for real-time feedback.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Cloud visualization of status and environment data.
